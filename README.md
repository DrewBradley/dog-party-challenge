# Dog Party Challenge

## Setup Info

- Clone down [the repo linked here](https://github.com/turingschool/dog-party-challenge).
- Note that some boilerplate code was provided to get you up and running a little quicker
- You will not need to use git or push any changes up to submit, so don't worry about making a repo, removing the remote repo, etc. Just get to work

## Your Challenge

- With your partner, work to recreate the comp provided in [the lesson](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-1/dog-party-challenge.html)
- You only have a little over an hour, so its likely you won't have time to make it pixel perfect - that's ok! Start with the general layout, then work your way into details.
